# Parent Class

*Use irb to run the following code:*

```ruby
s = 'abc'
puts s.public_methods.inspect
```

*You should find that it prints a list of all of the public methods available to the String `s`; this includes not only those methods defined in the `String` class, but also methods that are inherited from `Object` (which inherits other methods from the `BasicObject` class and the `Kernel` module). That's a lot of methods.*

*How would you modify this code to print just the public methods that are defined or overridden by the `String` class? That is, the list should exclude all members that are only defined in `Object`, `BasicObject`, and `Kernel`.*

According to the Ruby Docs:

`public_methods(all=true) → array

Returns the list of public methods accessible to `obj`. If the `all` parameter is set to `false`, only those methods in the receiver will be listed.

```ruby
puts s.public_methods(false).inspect
```
