# Create a method that takes two integers as arguments. The first argument is a count,
# and the second is the first number of a sequence that your method will create. The
# method should return an Array that contains the same number of elements as the count
# argument, while the values of each element will be multiples of the starting number.

# You may assume that the count argument will always have a value of 0 or greater, while
# the starting number can be any integer value. If the count is 0, an empty list should
# be returned.
